# Round 1:

Introduce yourself<br>
About internships<br>
Coding Questions (2) [I used JAVA to solve questions]<br>

1. `Given a year, print next 12 leap years.`

2. `Given an array of numbers, you have to print the numbers which are power of 7.`
   Eg: array = [343,14,49,21,33,20,91,87,1]<br>
   Output :<br>
   343 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;// 7^3 = 343<br>
   49 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;// 7^2 = 49<br>
   1 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;// 7^0 = 1<br>

Introduce yourself<br>
Asked about my projects<br>
My project had NextJS, so he asked what is difference between CSR and SSR in Nextjs.<br>
Coding Questions (3)<br>

1. `Given an array of marks and your marks, find your rank.`
   Eg: array = [36,34,36,35,31,32] my_marks = 33<br>
   Output<br>
   My rank is 4.<br>
   // NOTE : Both 36 mark students have rank as 1.<br>

2. `Find frequency count of each character in a string.`
   Eg: string="amazon"<br>
   Output:<br>
   a - 2<br>
   m - 1<br>
   z - 1<br>
   o - 1<br>
   n - 1<br>

3. `Balanced parathesis (Its a standard problem, you can find it on leetcode or geeksforgeeks).`
