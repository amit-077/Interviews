Coding Questions (2) [I used JAVA to solve questions]

1. `Given a year, print next 12 leap years.`

2. `Given an array of numbers, you have to print the numbers which are power of 7.`
   Eg: array = [343,14,49,21,33,20,91,87,1]
   Output :
   343 3 // 7^3 = 343
   49 2 // 7^2 = 49
   1 0 // 7^0 = 1
