# Round 1 (Online) :

Introduce yourself<br>
About internships<br>
Coding Questions (2) [I used JAVA to solve questions]<br>

1. `Given a year, print next 12 leap years.`

2. `Given an array of numbers, you have to print the numbers which are power of 7.`<br>
   Eg: array = [343,14,49,21,33,20,91,87,1]<br>
   Output :<br>
   343 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;// 7^3 = 343<br>
   49 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;// 7^2 = 49<br>
   1 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;// 7^0 = 1<br>
